# gh_pr_folder_search
pr-folder-search is a Bash tool that leverages GitHub's GraphQL API to search for pull requests that have changed files in a specific folder. The tool supports filtering by author and is ideal for pinpointing contributions that affect critical parts of your repository, like workflow configurations or other folder-specific changes.
